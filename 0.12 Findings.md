I will use this document to explain everything i tried in 0.12 and ended up not implementing.

# Attempt 1

## Document

At first i tried to change the current `JSONDocument` and `HASHDocument` to inherit all of the constructor building and common methods, ex:

```ts
abstract class Document {
    constructor(schema, ...) {
        this.#schema = schema
        ...
    }

    #populate() { ... }

    abstract toString(): string

    public get $id() {...}
    // etc...
}

class JSONDocument extends Document { ... }
```

This lead to huge performance issues, this simple change made the `Time per Request` jump from `0.2ms` to almost `0.4ms` which lead to more than `30ms` increase in **batch** requests for 1000 documents.

# Attempt 2

## Parsing to search strings

The new method **reduces** the amount of loops needed from 2 to 1, however doing this increases the model creation time by `0.1ms` but has a big plus, it being that it **reduces the memory footprint** since before the schema was also saved on the map and passed around to the Search class every time. Now the only information passed around are 2 strings per field, its `type` and its `path`.

# Attempt 3

## Document -> Plain Object

Due to the complex logic the classes do when initialized/constructed converting them into plain objects reduces its performance.
The penalty is not as huge as [attempt 1](#attempt-1) but exists

# Attempt 4

## Removing hidden behavior

Now by default `index` is set to `false`, this allows the user to fully control what to save and also improves the speed of json documents and also does not hit the database as hard.

# Attempt 5

## Remaking document parsers

This is quite the challenge, specially when it comes to hashes.

Right now the only parsers i will touch are the JSON ones, being honest im no with much patience to wrap my head around my old HASH code that is working even tho it skips some steps, i will leave hashes for a future attempt.

### JSON Parser

Tuples will only be transformed into `key-value` pairs if indexed, this will save tons of time and greatly increase performance. Other than that it just brings a much more readable and easier to maintain structure.

The changes went greatly, now JSON should not have any more edge cases and performance should actually be better than before, tho i will only run benchmarks when i finish attempt 5
